<h1>Users</h1>
You'll need a standard projector and a fog machine. Head over to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziG_0-8F9Vg to see what Blaize can do and to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjnYWlusAS8 to learn how to download and use it. Have fun and feel free to share some pictures/videos when it's working!<br>
Pro tip: Set the <strong>contrast</strong> and <strong>saturation</strong> of your projector to maximum for even more vivid colors.

<h1>Developers</h1>
Blaize 3 is currently not under active development, although I plan to integrate some feature requests from users in the YouTube comments in 2022 and unclutter the code in general. Feel free to integrate your own ideas or even re-structure the code. It's not the cleanest, as it started as one of my first Java/Processing projects.
If you have any questions or requests, you can contact me via email (bodgedbutworks<(at)>aerotrax<(dot)>de) or on Instagram (@bodgedbutworks).

You will need Processing 3 to run the code: https://processing.org/download
If you're missing libraries, you can simply install them using Processing's built-in library manager.

<h2>Why isn't the Android remote control app open source?</h2>
...because it's a pile of ravioli code from my early beginnings and I don't want to hurt your eyes.
If you like the app AND you REALLY want to spend time cleaning up smelly code, then feel free to message me an I can commit <del>a crime</del> the app's source code.
