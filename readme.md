# Releases
You can find prebuild binaries for each release on the [release page](https://github.com/bodgedbutworks/Blaize_V3/releases).
> **Note for mac users**: \
> If you download the prebuild releases they are considered suspicious and get a quarantine flag. This results in errors like `The application is corrupted and should be removed` and the application starting.
> This can be preventet by either installing Processing yourself and running the program from source or by removing the quarantine flag from the app.
> To remove the flag open a terminal window and execute the following command 
> ```
>  sudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine <path_to_your_Blaize_V3.app>
> ``` 
# Users
You'll need a standard projector and a fog machine. Head over to [Blaize 3 Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziG_0-8F9Vg) to see what Blaize can do and to [Blaize 3 HowTo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjnYWlusAS8) to learn how to download and use it. Have fun and feel free to share some pictures/videos when it's working!

Pro tip: Set the **contrast** and **saturation** of your projector to maximum for even more vivid colors.

# Developers
Blaize 3 is currently not under active development, although I plan to integrate some feature requests from users in the YouTube comments in 2022 and unclutter the code in general. Feel free to integrate your own ideas or even re-structure the code. It's not the cleanest, as it started as one of my first Java/Processing projects.
If you have any questions or requests, you can contact me via email (bodgedbutworks<(at)>aerotrax<(dot)>de) or on Instagram (@bodgedbutworks).

You will need Processing 3 to run the code: [Processing download](https://processing.org/download)

If you're missing libraries, you can simply install them using Processing's built-in library manager.
